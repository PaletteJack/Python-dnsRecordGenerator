### Python DNS record generator

Made this because I frequently have to create and add new DNS records. This allows you to put in the name of the subdomain and then generate records depending on what you need. Just update the dictionary object with the records needed.

Probably not the most optimized since I'm **not** great at python and had to figure out the hard way you can't access key/value pairs using dot notation. :(
